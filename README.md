# EasyRide

EasyRide is a ride-sharing platform connecting passengers and drivers using React and Firebase. It allows users to sign up as either drivers or passengers, book rides, manage bookings, and update their profiles. The application leverages Firebase Authentication and Firestore for secure user management and real-time data updates.

## Project Overview

EasyRide is designed to provide a seamless ride-sharing experience with the following key features:

- **User Authentication:**  
  Users can sign up and log in using their email and password. Firebase Authentication is used to manage user sessions and ensure persistent login across sessions.

- **Role-Based Access:**  
  Users register either as drivers or passengers. Drivers can post trips and manage bookings, while passengers can search for available rides and make reservations.

- **Profile Management:**  
  Users can update their profile information including full name, phone number, and address. The app checks for profile completeness to ensure all required fields are filled before accessing sensitive areas such as the dashboard.

- **Ride and Booking Management:**

  - Drivers can post trips with necessary details such as origin, destination, date, and available seats.
  - Passengers can search for trips that match their criteria and book rides.
  - Real-time data is managed using Firestore’s onSnapshot listeners for immediate updates.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The application is built with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and modern user interface.
